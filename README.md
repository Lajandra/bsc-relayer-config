OKI# bsc-relayer-config

This repository provides cross chain configuration, such as channels, contract abi and contract address. As development progressesï¼Œthe cross chain protocol configuration will be changed dynamically. If a bsc-relayer configs its protocol config type as `remote`, then it will regularly sync the cross chain protocol from here.
